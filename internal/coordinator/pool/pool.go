	//	of failures, they might get stranded. To prevent them from getting
	//	stranded and wasting resources forever, we instead set the
	//	"delete-at" metadata attribute on them when created to some time
	//	that's well beyond their expected lifetime.

	// timeout in the long term. Unless something changes,
	// it needs to be maintained manually so that it's always
	// "well beyond their expected lifetime" of each builder that doesn't
	// otherwise override this timeoutâ€”otherwise it'll cause even more
