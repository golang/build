Hello gophers,

We have just released Gopls v0.16.2-pre.1, a release candidate for the upcoming gopls release. It is picked from release branch gopls-release-branch.0.16 at commit abc123d.

If you have Go installed already, an easy way to try v0.16.2-pre.1 is by using the go command:

$ go install golang.org/x/tools/gopls@v0.16.2-pre.1

This gopls release is being tracked at https://go.dev/issue/12345.

Cheers,
The Go Tools Team
