Hello gophers,

We have just released Gopls v0.16.2. It is picked from release branch gopls-release-branch.0.16 at commit abc123d.

If you have Go installed already, an easy way to try v0.16.2 is by using the go command:

$ go install golang.org/x/tools/gopls@v0.16.2

Thanks to everyone who contributed to the release.

Cheers,
The Go Tools Team
