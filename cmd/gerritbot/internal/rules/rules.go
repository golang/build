// Package rules specifies a simple set of rules for checking GitHub PRs or Gerrit CLs
// for certain common mistakes, like no package in the first line of the commit message
// or having long lines in the commit message body.
//
// A rule is primarily defined via a function that takes a Change (CL or PR) as input
// and reports zero or 1 findings, which is just a string (usually 1-2 short sentences).
// A rule can also optionally return a note, which might be auxiliary advice such as
// how to edit the commit message.
//
// The FormatResults function renders the results into markdown.
// Each finding is shown to the user, currently in a numbered list of findings.
// The auxiliary notes are deduplicated, so that for example a set of rules
// looking for problems in a commit message can all return the same editing advice
// but that advice is then only shown to the user only once.
//
// For example, for a commit message with a first line of:
//
//	fmt: Improve foo and bar.
//
// That would currently trigger two rules, with an example formatted result of
// the following (including the deduplicated advice at the end):
//
//	Possible problems detected:
//	  1. The first word in the commit title after the package should be a
//	     lowercase English word (usually a verb).
//	  2. The commit title should not end with a period.
//
//	 To edit the commit message, see instructions [here](...). For guidance on commit
//	 messages for the Go project, see [here](...).
//
// Rules currently err on the side of simplicity and avoiding false positives.
// It is intended to be straightforward to add a new rule.
//
// Rules can be arranged to trigger completely independently of one another,
// or alternatively a set of rules can optionally be arranged in groups that
// form a precedence based on order within the group, where at most one rule
// from that group will trigger. This can be helpful in cases like:
//   - You'd like to have a "catch all" rule that should only trigger if another rule
//     in the same group hasn't triggered.
//   - You have a rule that spots a more general problem and rules that spot
//     more specific or pickier variant of the same problem and want to have
//     the general problem reported if applicable without also reporting
//     pickier findings that would seem redundant.
//   - A subset of rules that are otherwise intended to be mutually exclusive.
