This branch holds LUCI configuration for the Go project.

The configuration is defined by `main.star`.
Use `go generate` to update generated files. (Under the hood it runs `./main.star`.)
Use `lucicfg fmt` to format `main.star`.

You will need the `lucicfg` program.
See https://www.chromium.org/developers/how-tos/depottools/#installing
to install it.

Configuration changes take effect within minutes of CL submission.
You can view the status at https://config.luci.app/config_set/projects/golang.
